        <h3 class="howto">To configure a slot with a peripheral card</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Preferences under the Mariani menu and navigate to the Computer pane.</li>
            <li>Click on the option corresponding to a peripheral slot.</li>
            <li>Select an option from the pop-up list.</li>
            <li>Click on the Reboot Emulator button for the selection(s) to take effect.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>AppleWin limits certain cards to certain slots and and Mariani inherits these limits, so you may need to check a few of the slots for a specific peripheral. Certain cards also require multiple slots, so selecting them will also change the setting in another slot. Rebooting is required because Apple II software don't expect the hardware configuration to change while the computer is powered on.</p>
