    <h2>Enhanced Speed for Floppy Drives</h2>
    <p>By default, Mariani speeds up the emulator during floppy disk access for faster performance. If a program relies on the emulator running at an "authentic" speed to function correctly, uncheck the Enhanced speed for floppy drives setting in the Storage pane of Preferences.</p>
